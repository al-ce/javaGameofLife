## Credits

This is being developed while reading [Conway's Game of Life by Nathaniel Johnston and Dave Greene](https://conwaylife.com/book/). Patterns in the demo, colors for the heatmap, and more features in this program were sourced from the online version of that book.

## Features

- **Interactive cells**: clicking toggles state
- **Generation tracking**: track generations in the display bar
- **"Afterlife" heatmap**: dead cells change color based on the most recent living cell
- **Play controls**: autoplay (*p*), step (*space*), clear (*escape*), tick speed controls (*1-5*)
